## Introduction

The IPC Query System is developed to facilitate easy access to legal information contained within the Indian Penal Code. By utilizing Pinecone's vector database, the system ensures quick and precise retrieval of sections based on user queries.

## Features

- Efficient querying of IPC sections
- High accuracy in retrieving relevant legal information
- Fast search capabilities using Pinecone's vector database

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pinecone VectorDB
- Hugging Face APIs
- Embeddings: E5 (Small)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ipc-query-system.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. View the IPC data by parsing the provided PDF:
    - Download the PDF from [IPC 1860](https://www.iitk.ac.in/wc/data/IPC_186045.pdf).
    - Use a PDF parsing library (e.g., PyMuPDF, pdfminer), I have used PyPDFDirectoryLoader from langchain's document_loaders.

2. Index the IPC data into Pinecone:
    ```python
    import pinecone
    pc = pinecone.Pinecone(api_key=PC_KEY)
    index_name = "<index-name>"
    index = pc.Index(index_name)
    ```

3. Start the query system:
    ```python
    streamlit app.py
    ```

4. Access the system via your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

5. Enter your query in the search bar to retrieve relevant IPC sections.
